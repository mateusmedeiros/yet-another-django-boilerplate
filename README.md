yet-another-django-boilerplate
==============================

I'll update this readme ~~soon~~ not as soon as I hoped, but for now, the main points:

This is a django boilerplate that includes app boilerplate and project boilerplate, both designed with Django 1.7 and Python 3 in mind.
I made it for some projects of mine so it was made to fill my needs. But it's here in case anyone likes it.

for project you should (probably) use 

```
django-admin.py startproject --template=https://github.com/mateusmedeiros/yadb-project/archive/master.zip name-of-your-project
```

for app

```
django-admin.py startapp --template=https://github.com/mateusmedeiros/yadb-app/archive/master.zip name-of-your-app
```

I'll make some better one-line commands and stuff as soon as I revamp this.

~~Note: Right now it's totally untested. I made it with one project in mind and I'll use it for that project. That will be my test.~~

Used it for one project and fixed some errors. Will test it again when I work with Django again, but it's probably more stable now.
