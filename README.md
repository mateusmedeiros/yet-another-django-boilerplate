This is unmaintained. I'm not working with Django anymore, I don't know how useful this project can be nowadays. :confused:

Yet Another Django Boilerplate
==============================

This is a django boilerplate that includes app boilerplate and project boilerplate, both designed with Django 1.7 and Python 3 in mind.
I made it for some projects of mine so it was made to fill my needs. But it's here in case anyone likes it.

```
django-admin.py startproject --template=https://github.com/mateusmedeiros/yadb-project/archive/master.zip name-of-your-project
```
```
django-admin.py startapp --template=https://github.com/mateusmedeiros/yadb-app/archive/master.zip name-of-your-app
```
